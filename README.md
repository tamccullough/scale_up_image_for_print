# scale_up_image_for_print
by culla

This will allow the user accurately to scale a digital image for printing.

You will need to install python on your machine

download python

FOR WINDOWS just use the executable

FOR linux based systems you should already have Python installed. I would assume Mac systems have it bundled too?

And install the dependencies Pillow

pip install --upgrade Pillow

IN WINDOWS you may need to use "py -m" at the beginning

-py -m pip install --pre gql[all]

OR alternatively you can just double click the py file itself that you want to use.

FOR MAC (I don't own or use a Mac but these intructions should be substitable)
